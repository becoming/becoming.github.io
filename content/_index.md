## Hello dear padavan

This curriculum will teach you lots of smart things about informatics. You'll have the choice to... hold on, you'll have no choice, rather, you'll have to blindly learn the things in here. 

You have no right unless you can pass the technical interview with me, the author of this curriculum.
