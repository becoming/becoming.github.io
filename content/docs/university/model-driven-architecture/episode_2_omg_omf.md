# Episode 2, OMG OMF

Object Management Group __OMG__ + Meta Object Facility __MOF__.

> This material is a very short summary of the official document from OMG : [omg.org/ocup-2/documents/Meta-ModelingAndtheMOF.pdf](https://www.omg.org/ocup-2/documents/Meta-ModelingAndtheMOF.pdf)

## OMG

OMG - The Object Management Group® (OMG®) is an international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium, founded in 1989.

## MOF

MOF - The Meta Object Facility provides an open and platform-independent metadata management framework and associated set of metadata services to enable the development and interoperability of model-and metadata-driven systems.

The MOF2.5 specification provides the basis for metamodel definition in OMG’s family of modeling languages (including the UML) and is based on a simplification of UML 2’s class modeling capabilities.
In addition to providing the means for metamodel definition, it adds core capabilities for model management in general including Identifiers, a simple generic Tag capability and Reflective operations that are defined generically and can be applied regardless of metamodel

> Basically, OMF uses UML elements to build concepts used in UML.

An amazing thesis about MOF : [Overbeek, J.F. (2006) Meta Object Facility (MOF): investigation of the state of the art.](http://essay.utwente.nl/57286/)
