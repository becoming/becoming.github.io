# Episode 1, Introduction

As Object Management Group OMG states [omg.org/mda](https://www.omg.org/mda/) : 

{{< hint >}}

Model Driven Architecture® (MDA®) is an approach to software design, development and implementation spearheaded by the OMG. MDA provides guidelines for structuring software specifications that are expressed as models.

MDA separates business and application logic from underlying platform technology. Platform-independent models of an application or integrated system’s business functionality and behavior, built using UML and the other associated OMG modeling standards, can be realized through the MDA on virtually any platform, open or proprietary, including Web Services, .NET, CORBA R, J2EE, and others. These __platform-independent models__ document the business functionality and behavior of an application __separate__ from the __technology-specific code__ that implements it, insulating the core of the application from technology and its relentless churn cycle while enabling interoperability both within and across platform boundaries. No longer tied to each other, the business and technical aspects of an application or integrated system can each evolve at its own pace - business logic responding to business need, and technology taking advantage of new developments - as the business requires.

## As a side note

- _The reality however demonstrates that regardless of how generic is your model is designed - you have to consider the tech you are using._
- _There are important examples who where highly generic, like CORBA and JEE, however we usually refer to them in past tense._
- _As a rule of thumb: the closer you are to implementation, the less generic/platform-independent your model's design is._

## In French

There's an amazing course __in french__ about Model Driven Architecture : [ecariou.perso.univ-pau.fr/cours/idm/cours-meta.pdf](http://ecariou.perso.univ-pau.fr/cours/idm/cours-meta.pdf).
