# Episode 1, Java Dev Kit

Choosing the right JDK (_Java Development Kit_) really depends on what your plans are.

## Quick Choice

__No time to lose ?__ 

Go to [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) then download the default selected JDK.

## Versions 

There are 2 types of versions now : LTS and the rest.
LTS stands for _Long Term Support_. The vendors of free or commercial JDKs will most likely support only the LTS versions.

At the time of writing of this page, the latest LTS versions are 8 and 11, the next LTS is expected to be the 18th.

## General purpose JDK

[Adoptium](https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2020/06/adoptopenjdk-to-join-the-eclipse-foundation/) (_a.k.a. AdoptOpenJDK_) is the way to go in most of the cases - free for dev, free in prod.

The official site is (_for now_) is : [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
