# Episode 2, IDE

Choosing the right IDE will help you code faster, with less bugs.

This material is purely about coding Spring Boot apps with Java. Therefore we'll focus on what matters most.

## Intellij Idea

You need to __get the Ultimate__ edition - __not__ the Community one.

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download

The huge difference is in the support for Spring Boot.

Please, do not install the default proposed plugins. If you need help with that, I can provide it for a small fee --> https://becoming.tech/#author--contact.

Or use my article about it: https://becoming.tech/docs/java/season_1/episode_6/

## Alternatives

{{< hint info >}}
1. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or a [Spring Boot optimized version](https://spring.io/tools)
1. [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) - Look for LTS version
1. [VS Code with Spring Boot Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack)
