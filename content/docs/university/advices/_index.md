> You’ve chosen a wonderful journey. It’s 200% sure that you will find a job quickly, and the salary will probably be cool as well.
> 
> However, it’s up to you to build an interesting career, and to be happy to wake up every morning as an IT professional.
> 
> My advices are :
> 
> - Your job won’t be a “8:00 to 17:00” job. You constantly need to renew yourself, so please : go to conferences, read books, be part of communities, … ( + of course do a lot of other non-IT activities)
> - There are still people who think that IT guys wear ugly glasses, that they never see the sun … Show them that this is not true. How ? Communicate ! All the time ! Show what you have developed, have lunch with people from outside your IT department, attend non-IT events, etc. (+ find nice glasses)
> - There are a lot of different jobs in IT. Believe me. A lot ! So, find the job that you like. If you don’t like your job, leave it ! This is really important to keep you motivated most of the time
> - Last but not least : Have fun !

> These are my advices for becoming architect :
> 
> First, there are different types of architectures : Business architecture, Application architecture, Technical architecture and Infrastructure architecture. 
> All of these are equally important.
> 
> When you have to manage a project from an architecture point of view, the __Business architecture__ is the what & why : What does the business want to do ?  It’s the first phase : Collecting the requirements. And then you have to understand these requirements and often ask ‘why ?’ why the business want to do stg (if you don’t understand why that may means that it’s not clear even for the business so ask why three times J)
>
> After this business phase, you can begin the __Application architecture__ : How. (how I will design my application ?) at this stage process are necessary. Try to map the systems on the process. You can then scope the functional area of your systems to be dev (what feature in what system).
> Then you cope with the techno (software constraints) and after that you will deploy on infrastructure (hardware constraints).
>
> Two more advices :
> - Never begin an application design without clear requirements. That means : spend time with business team, talk the same language (ubiquitous language)
> - Don’t make a one-page diagram with everything inside. Flows, features, IP address, exchange protocols, etc. 
> - Make a view point for each type of architecture domain : 
>   - One for business architecture
>   - One for application architecture, 
>   - One for technical
>   - One with the infrastructure. 
>   This will help you to have the right support to discuss with the different stakeholders : Business, dev, ..

### Devenir Architect

> [Julien Thaï, IT Architect at Banque Internationale à Luxembourg (BIL)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienthai/)
>
> Cependant je te dirai qu’en tant qu’architecte on ne doit se concentrer que sur la technique, il nous faut aussi challenger le besoin en posant la question « pourquoi » 3 fois.
> 
> Notre but c’est de répondre au mieux au besoin du client si ce dernier est justifié et c’est pourquoi la question précédente nous permettra de mieux saisir de quoi il a besoin.
> 
> Ensuite il faut que cela en vaille la peine et aborder une approche MVP.
