# Episode 2

This time we'll start writing actual apps. We need to pick one subject and do the app for it.

Every year we pick something different:
- 2017: dating site
- 2018: gaming site
- 2019: pub management app
- 2020: ?

We'll start with https://start.spring.io

{{< expand "Dependencies we'll start with" >}}
- web
- h2
- liquibase
- spring-data
- actuators
- configuration processor
- lombok
