# Episode 2

This time we'll start writing actual apps. We need to pick one subject and do the app for it.

Every year we pick something different:
- 2017: dating site
- 2018: gaming site
- 2019: pub management app
- 2020: ?

We'll start with https://start.spring.io

{{< expand "Dependencies we'll start with" >}}
- web
- h2
- liquibase
- spring-data
- actuators
- configuration processor
- lombok
{{< /expand >}}

No we'll import the app and start adding features, one by one.

{{< expand "Dependencies we'll start with" >}}
- Get all entities
- Add one entity
- Get one by ID
- Delete entity
- Update entity 
{{< /expand >}}

During this time we'll touch lots of patterns. 
Most of them are very basic, yet very powerful.

{{< expand "Patterns, concepts and things" >}}
- MVC
- DI
- Singleton
- Proxy
- SOLID
- KISS
- YAGNI
- DRY
{{< /expand >}}
