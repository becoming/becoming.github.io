# Episode 1

We'll do a bunch of exercises to introduce some fundamental elements:
- It is easy to blame.
- It is hard to create.

## Exercise 1 

Describe on a paper an algorithm, in a human language (_fr, en, ro_) of your choice, for something you do every day, examples of actions:
- Clean teeth
- Drink a glass of water
- Use some app on your smartphone
- Place a call

Pick one and write on paper or some notepad app, no diagrams required.

{{< expand "Things to do once algorithms are on paper" >}}
1. Swap algorithms with colleagues.
2. Reproduce the received algorithm "_ad literam_", instruction by instruction.
3. You shall not add "_from you_" any step.
4. At the end you'll notice that it is impossible to execute it.
5. Every single person will fail to accomplish this basic thing.

{{< expand "Let's analyze the results" >}}
- There are missing steps
- Existing steps are not detailed enough.
- The name and description of the algorithm might not match.
- You prefer english, yet you'll receive it in french.
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Initial conclusion" >}}
Now, who's to blame ? 
- The one who executed.
- The one who wrote the algo.

Pick one!

There's no right or wrong, as it was said during Covid19 Pandemic:

## Exercise 2

Create one java application, examples of subjects:
- Basic calculator.
- A simple bot.
- Console menu, with 5 options.
- A basic dictionary with 5 words.

The app should be simple and doable in 10 minutes.

{{< expand "Things to do once the time is over" >}}
1. How much people said they are ready ?
2. How many apps are compiling ?
3. How many apps are running ?
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Let's analyze the results" >}}
- Let's see how many features are implemented.
- Is there some kind of documentation ?
- Did somebody write tests ?
- Who asked details on what needs to be done ?
- Who used a framework, or a build tool ?
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "The real world" >}}
- It is hard to write nice code in tight deadline.
- You really need tests, otherwise how can you prove your code is working ?
  - by hand ? really ?!
- You need to practice to write good code.
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "Actual conclusion / Wisdom" >}}
- Do reviews of your old code.
- Create precedents and document them.
- Create or use cook books with ready to use recipes.
- Avoid re-inventing wheels.
  - Have some time ? Do some actual R&D
