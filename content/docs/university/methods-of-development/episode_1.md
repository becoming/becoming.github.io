# Episode 1

We'll do a bunch of exercises to introduce some fundamental elements:
- It is easy to blame.
- It is hard to create.

## Exercise 1 

Describe on a paper an algorithm, in a human language (_fr, en, ro_) of your choice, for something you do every day, examples of actions:
- Clean teeth
- Drink a glass of water
- Use some app on your smartphone
- Place a call

Pick one and write on paper or some notepad app, no diagrams required.

{{< expand "Things to do after" >}}
1. Swap algorithms with colleagues.
2. Reproduce the received algorithm "_ad literam_", instruction by instruction.
3. You shall not add "_from you_" any step.
4. At the end you'll notice that it is impossible to execute it.
5. Every single person will fail to accomplish this basic thing.

{{< expand "Most common reasons" >}}
- There are missing steps
- Existing steps are not detailed enough.
- The name and description of the algorithm might not match.
- You prefer english, yet you'll receive it in french.

{{< expand "Conclusion:" >}}
Now, who's to blame ? 
- The one who executed.
- The one who wrote the algo.

Pick one!

## Exercise 2

Create one java application, examples of subjects:
- Basic calculator.
- A simple bot.

The app should be simple and doable in 10-15 minutes.
