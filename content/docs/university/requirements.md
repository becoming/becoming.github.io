## Java JDK and Runtime

To compile and build java apps we'll use a JDK. Since there are multiple ways and versions to do it, you can pick one 
of the methods bellow.

- You can follow the guide from my Java Curriculum: [Episode 1, Install Java](/docs/java/season_1/episode_1/).
- Or use the [Intellij Idea's feature to do that](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#jdk).

## Maven

We'll use `maven` as "_technical project management tool_".

- You can use the guide from [My Java Curriculum](/docs/java/season_1/episode_3/)
- Or use the [embedded maven installation from Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html)
