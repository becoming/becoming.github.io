We are going to run the app to make sure everything works. For this we'll use use maven first:

1. Open the `maven` panel (*on the to the right*).
1. You'll see the name of your project.
1. Navigate to `Lifecycle` and double click on `package`.
1. `Run` panel will open at the bottom and will show you the logs form this action.
1. It'll take a while till the action will finish, in the end you'll see a message saying `BUILD SUCCESS`
1. In the `maven` panel navigate to `Plugins / spring-boot` and double click on `spring-boot:run`
1. This will open the `Run` panel, and you'll see lots of logs
