# Episode 1, Install Java

[Season 1 - From Lame to Fame](/docs/java/season_1/)

In order to start creating Java apps we need to install the Java itself on our computer.
> Java Development Kit = _JDK_

#### Linux

> Ubuntu = _A GNU Linux distribution, "a version of Linux"_

We'll use Ubuntu as reference distribution. The steps might lightly differ from one distribution to another.

In Linux there are several ways to install java, we'll do it the cool way - via Terminal.

1. Open the terminal, via `Ctrl + Alt + T` or find the _Terminal_ or _Konsole_ application in the apps menu, usually opened via `Win` button.
1. Type with your bare hands `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`, press key `Enter`. You'll be asked for password, type it and press again `Enter`.

1. Wait for magic to happen then check if all went well by checking the java version. For that we'll type in the same console `java -version` then press `Enter`.
