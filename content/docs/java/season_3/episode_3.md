# Episode 3, Contact List

[Season 3 - I know Kung Fu](/docs/java/season_3/)

{{< hint warning >}}
**Warning!** This episode will be hard. Please be well rested before you start!
{{< /hint >}}

We'll build a small contact list.

This time we'll write lots of code in lots of classes. It'll be like an adorable *puppies attack*!

{{< youtube wRs08ZbVMmI >}}

The scope of this exercise is to create (*once again*) multiple `.java` files with classes and functions inside them. 
This time, however, we'll use something called `interface` in order to define a **contract** and oblige a class to *implement* that contract.
Then these classes and their functions will interact with each other as usual.

Again, no static classes nor functions. Plus,we'll learn that we can get overflown with files and 
will get prepared for next season where we are going to understand how we can organize our code.
