# Episode 2, Exchange

[Season 3 - I know Kung Fu](/docs/java/season_3/)

We'll build a small application that's capable of converting currency from EUR to USD or MDL.

There are different ways to do it, check the video below to get amazed.

The scope of this exercise is to create (*again*) multiple `.java` files with classes and functions inside them.
Then these classes and their functions will interact with each other.

This time, however, we are **NOT** going to use static variables and functions, apart from the `public static void main(...` since this one is the starting function of our application.
We'll favour creation of instances (*objects*) and calling their functions.
