# Episode 1, Calculator

[Season 3 - I know Kung Fu](/docs/java/season_3/)

We'll build a small application that's capable of doing simple calculations, like 1 + 2 = 4.

Why 4, you might ask, because every program might have a bug.

The scope of this exercise is to create multiple `.java` files with classes and functions inside them.
Then these classes and their functions will interact with each other.

We are going to use quite a lot of static variables and functions. 
This is not ok to use in real applications, but is easier to start with.
