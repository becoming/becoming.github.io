# Becoming a Java Developer

Here you have a curated list of resources you can learn from. 

The price ranges from FREE to USD 50 a month or USD 350 per course. In time the prices might vary. 

## How it works

### You learn
You can learn from existing resources - Internet is full of them. 
Bellow you'll find the ones that I consider the best. 

### If you need help, I can mentor you
If you feel lost and need help, I can offer you mentoring services. These are for money.
Feeling interested, ping me via one of these ways : [Contact section](/#author--contact)

> N.B. I do not receive money for advertising, I do recommend these courses as I know they work.
