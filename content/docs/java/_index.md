# Becoming a Java Developer

> Hello, it'll be hard!

Congrats junior, you just decided to stop being lame and start learning Java programming language. 

Before you go further, you need to decide what **pill** you gonna take ?

[Take Red Pill](/docs/java/season_1/)  |  [Take Blue Pill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3FdSuXHXF8)


Or, If you are not bored to death by now, go further to:
  - [Season 1 - From Lame to Fame](/docs/java/season_1/)

You think you mastered kung-fu ? Then go to:
  - [Season 2 - I know Kung-Fu](/docs/java/season_2/)
